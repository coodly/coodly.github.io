## Privacy policy

This policy applies to all information collected by Gambrinus app.

#### **Gambrinus**
Gambrinus pulls posts anonymously from Blogger using [BloggerAPI][2]. Rating meta-data is read anonymously from a shared iCloud container.

#### **Your Consent**
By using Gambrinus, you consent to our privacy policy.

---
#### Personally-Identifying Information

**Gambrinus** does not gather or transmit any Personally-Identifying Information outside of your local device. It only stores preferences about the user interface within its local database.

#### Business Transfers

If **Gambrinus**, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that **Gambrinus** goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be amended. (As **Gambrinus** does not collect any information about you there is very little effect this would likely have in practice.)

#### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, **Gambrinus** may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at **Gambrinus**â€™s sole discretion. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

#### Indemnity

You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of the use of this app or any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.
